It is a challenge project from [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/practice/projects/games-of-chance)

Please find descriptions below:
1. Create a function that simulates flipping a coin and calling either "Heads" or "Tails".
This function should also have a parameter that lets the player call either "Heads" or "Tails".
If the player wins the game, the function should return the amount that they won.
If the player loses the game, the function should return the amount that they lost as a negative number.

2. Create a function that simulates playing the game Cho-Han. The function should simulate rolling two dice and adding the results together. 
The player predicts whether the sum of those dice is odd or even and wins if their prediction is correct.

3. Create a function that simulates two players picking a card randomly from a deck of cards. The higher number wins.

4. Create a function that simulates some of the rules of roulette. A random number should be generated that determines which space the ball lands on.
